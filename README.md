# Intrastore Thunk

A Redux store meant to be shared within a single web app by its components.

This version uses Redux Thunk rather than Redux Saga.  Thunk is generally easier for new developers, but
it is more difficult to test against.

See the [Microfront Reference Readme](https://github.com/rhyeen/microfront_reference) for more information.

See the [Intrastore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/intrastore) original package for the Redux Saga version.
